# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project uses the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset** to train a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health-related attributes.

## 📌 Overview
The model uses:
- **StandardScaler** for feature standardization.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a linear kernel for classification.
- **Accuracy Score** for evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is the **(https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0uiujtei423te1q4kvrny/diabetes.csv?rlkey=20xvytca6xbio4vsowi2hdj8e&e=1&dl=0)**, which contains:
- **8 Features** (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age, etc.)
- **1 Target**: `Outcome`  
  - `0` → Not Diabetic  
  - `1` → Diabetic
